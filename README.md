openSCAD-projects
=================

herein lies a few of my openSCAD projects. They can be viewed in openSCAD, which is freely available at http://www.openscad.org/

as of writing Ive made two projects I've published to Thingiverse; a parametric Cherry MX Keycap and a parametric Cherry MX Mounting plate. While they are hosted just fine on thingiverse it would be nice to have a history, and to keep all my code in one place.

openSCAD only allows for static variables and no classes so if you're picking through this I would keep that in mind
